Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection Using CNN and DNN with a GUI
Overview
This repository contains the code for a deep learning project aimed at detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It includes two models: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Dense Neural Network (DNN), along with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using Tkinter for easy interaction and prediction.

Project Structure
CNN_Model/: Contains the code for the CNN model.
DNN_Model/: Contains the code for the DNN model.
GUI/: Contains the code for the graphical user interface.
Data/: Directory for storing X-ray image data (not included in the repository due to privacy and size constraints).
Docs/: Additional documentation and resources.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
PIL
Tkinter

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn pillow
Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. If it's not installed, you can install it based on your operating system.

Usage
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman3030/Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN-and-DNN-with-a-GUI.git
Prepare the Dataset: Place your dataset in the Data/ directory.
Train the Models: Run the CNN and DNN model scripts to train the models.
Launch the GUI: Run the GUI script for interactive predictions.
